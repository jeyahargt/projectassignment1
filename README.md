Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium &amp; Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. This project would enable data-driven decision-making, improve operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

Approach:
Data Scraping: Use Selenium to automate the extraction of Redbus data including routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.

Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a SQL database.

Streamlit Application: Develop a Streamlit application to display and filter the scraped data. Implement various filters such as bustype, route, price range, star rating, availability.

Data Analysis/Filtering using Streamlit: Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs. Use Streamlit to allow users to interact with and filter the data through the application.
